# US Food Desert Visualization Map

This project presents a Tableau-based interactive map visualizing the distribution of food deserts across the United States, based on 2010 population and food accessibility data.

## Overview

- **Data Source**: USDA Food Access Research Atlas 
- **Visualization Tool**: Tableau Public
- **Analysis**: The visualization reveals that food deserts are not only a rural problem but are also present in major cities, where economic and transportation inequalities exacerbate access issues.
Addressing food deserts requires targeted interventions that consider both geographic and socioeconomic factors, including poverty reduction, transportation improvements, and localized grocery store development.
